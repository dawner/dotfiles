Personal setup files to reduce overhead in configuring a new machine with my preferences

```
git clone https://github.com/dawner/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install
```

_Note: errors may occur if some files like .zshrc or .gitconfig already exist an error will be thrown to ensure no changes are overriden. If an error ocurrs, move offending files to a new location before running installation script, then add back any existing config that is missing._
